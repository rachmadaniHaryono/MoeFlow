## Project Introduction

This project is related to [freedomofkeima/transfer-learning-anime](https://github.com/freedomofkeima/transfer-learning-anime).

### Background

This project is heavily inspired from characters indexing website such as [saucenao](https://saucenao.com/) and [iqdb](https://www.iqdb.org/). In general, character indexing websites work well since character arts are generally limited in terms of number compared to real-life photos.

However, there are cases where character indexing websites will not work well, e.g.: the image is cropped or altered.

Or, there are cases where you want to recognize a character from a photo.

### Transfer Learning

This project only uses [~~30~~* 60 images per character](100_class_traning_note.md) for learning, which are very low in number for image recognition learning. However, this number is chosen since the majority of characters has a limited number of arts.

In [yande.re](https://yande.re/tag?name=&order=count&type=4), there are around 35000 registered character tags. However, top 1000 characters only have 70+ images while top 2000 characters only have 40+ images.

(*) The number of dataset is increased from ~30 to ~60 and the overall accuracy is increased by 5% to 10% (from 60% - 65% to 70%).

## Requirements

- TensorFlow 1.4.0 (`pip install tensorflow==1.4.0` first)
- [nagadomi/animeface-2009](https://github.com/nagadomi/animeface-2009)

## How to create initial environment

Python Environment:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/freedomofkeima/MoeFlow
$ cd MoeFlow
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv  # Ensure python3 version is 3.5, otherwise TensorFlow might not work
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip install .
$ # install TensorFlow
$ pip install .[tensorflow]
$ # or
$ pip install tensorflow==1.4.0
$ # install python animeface (optional)
$ pip install .[python_animeface]
$ # if python-animeface raise patchelf error, download patchelf-wrapper to fix it(optional)
$ pip install .[patchelf_wrapper]
```

Since `nagadomi/animeface-2009` is an independent project and you want to use it,
you need to clone it somewhere in your local directory.
Note that the project requires Ruby, ImageMagick, and gcc to run.

After you finish installing it, go to `detect.rb` and update the `require` part (line 4) accordingly.

After that, you need to download MoeFlow model via `models/download_model.sh` (~ 100 MB).

## How to run

After running steps above, you simply run.
On this example we will run with
model path on `/path/to/MoeFlow/models`, host `127.0.0.1` and port 5008

```
$ export MOEFLOW_MODEL_PATH='/path/to/MoeFlow/models'
$ moeflow --port 5008 --host 127.0.0.1
```

If your application is configured to run in a relative path, e.g.: [https://freedomofkeima.com/moeflow/](https://freedomofkeima.com/moeflow/),
then you can set static URL path via `export MOEFLOW_RELATIVE_URL_PATH='/moeflow/'`.
